Here’s a high-level chronological roadmap to build an Open-Source Page Builder with modern tech, styling, and AI capabilities for WordPress:

1. Discovery & Product Planning

- Define core agency needs: speed, flexibility, plugin compatibility, multi-site support.
- Analyze existing builders (Divi, Elementor, Bricks) for plugin conflicts and performance pain points.
- Prioritize:
  - Visual editor inside wp-admin
  - Clean HTML output
  - Plugin-friendly architecture

2. Environment & Core Architecture

- Set up local WordPress dev environment (e.g., with Docker).
- Create a base plugin (PHP + React admin app using WordPress’s @wordpress/scripts).
- Define internal page builder data format (likely stored as post meta or custom post type).
- Set up TailwindCSS and component library (ShadCN-style or custom).

3. Core Builder Interface (React inside WP Admin)

- Build React drag-and-drop layout engine inside WP admin.
- Create block system (Section, Row, Column, Text, Image, Button).
- Save layout state to WordPress using wp.apiFetch.
- Auto-render frontend using clean PHP templates and Tailwind classes.

4. Visual Style Controls

- Implement real-time visual style panel (spacing, color, fonts, effects).
- Sync style updates to Tailwind utility classes.
- Save style preferences per block and globally.

5. Plugin & Theme Compatibility Layer

- Ensure builder output is rendered using standard WP the_content filter.
- Auto-detect and respect other plugin hooks (WooCommerce, ACF, SEO, etc.).
- Allow injecting plugin shortcodes and blocks inside our builder.

6. Template & Section Library

- Build template/section manager (prebuilt headers, footers, hero sections, etc.).
- Allow save-as-template, reuse across sites/projects.
- Create export/import system (JSON + assets).

7. AI Integration

- Prompt-based block creation ("Add a pricing section").
- Auto-fill dummy content with OpenAI or local LLMs.
- Auto-generate section layouts based on page intent.

8. UX Polishing & Quality of Life

- Undo/redo, autosave, keyboard shortcuts.
- Version control and preview before publishing.
- Multi-user editing conflict detection.

9. SEO, Accessibility, Performance

- Clean semantic markup (not div soup).
- Lighthouse-ready by default.
- Built-in accessibility checks and suggestions.

10. Packaging & Monetization

- Offer free core + paid advanced components.
- Add white-labeling options for agencies.
- License management for clients (optional).
